### Hey there üëã

Welcome to my development page!

### Projects ‚ú®

I work on many different projects, closed and open source. Some creations are mine and some others I contribute.

* **[Anomalous Space](https://github.com/the-crazyball/anomalousspace)**, a Sci-Fi game Discord Bot set it space where you explore, mine and gain resources to get back home. With its procedural universe the posibilities are endless. This bot is also built on a micro-service infrastructure backend where Discord is just a client that talks to the game server via an API. This opens up the possibilities of having any kind of client connect and play (Slack, Discord, iOS, Android, even a Web version). Still a work in progress... Want to contribute, you can, it's [open source](https://github.com/the-crazyball/anomalousspace). You can also join [Official Anomalous Space Server](https://discord.gg/hUw2VmtzhX) for more information.
* **Dungeons Adventure RPG**, this is where my Dicord Bot building started, sadly it's offline now. But what a great learning experience!
* **[IdleLands-automation](https://github.com/the-crazyball/idleLands-automation)**, a cool helper script to play [IdleLands](https://play.idle.land/). I created the helper script initially and now it's maintained by [Marno](https://github.com/marnovandermaas).
* **[Elvarion](https://www.elvarion.com)**, closed source HTML5 2D MMORPG. Still working on this one when I have time.
* Plenty of other projects that are private, and sworn to secrecy. ;)

### Skills & Tools üñ±Ô∏è

I usually learn the hard way by doing everything from scratch. I use **Javascript** and **Node.js** for most of my projects with a **Mongo** database. I also have a variety of tools and languages that I've learned to use throughout the years, **PHP**, **.NET**, **Cold Fusion**, **Classic ASP**, **Perl**, **Python**, you name it. **Photoshop** and **Illustrator** are my go to image editors.
